				"Brass Casings play a pivotal role in crafting, with brass being the primary material for their production. The creation of brass involves a distinct process where copper and zinc ingots are combined. This combination takes place in a basin, utilizing a mixer to amalgamate these ingots. A blaze burner powers this process, supplying the necessary heat to alloy copper and zinc into brass."
				""
				"After producing the brass, it's essential to press it into plates, a key step in the crafting workflow. These brass plates form the core element in the fabrication of Brass Casings. In a manner akin to Copper Casings, these plates are then affixed to stripped logs, resulting in the formation of Brass Casings."

The synergy of Brass Casings and Precision Mechanisms is crucial for creating these advanced machines. Known for their high-level functionality and accuracy, Brass Machines are integral to executing more sophisticated and detailed crafting operations."

Both forms of copper are integral to crafting and machine creation."
